						<h2><br />In-market redesign</h2>
						<h3>Background</h3>
						<p>An update to the driver’s companion app had launched with poor customer ratings. Requiring a quick turnaround to fix key issues that had caused poor 
							CSAT and app store reviews. Providing an opportunity for the newly formed central design team to take ownership. Unfortunately, the original design team 
							in the US had disbanded so minimal handover was possible.</p>
						<h3>Approach</h3>
						<p class="noPadding">The business wanted a quick response to resolve the rating problem, influencing the approach taken and reduced the upfront research and 
							testing that could be conducted.</p>
						<br />
						<h3>Research</h3>
						<p class="noPadding">Firstly, I reviewed survey responses and app reviews to identify the main areas of frustration. Then an expert review of problem 
							areas to form assumptions on possible symptoms. Finally, I leveraged existing secondary research, a recent survey with app users, to understand 
							attitudes and preferences.<br />Revealing:</p>
						<ul style="width : 90%;">
							<li>Low correlation between ‘must-have’ features and actual usage</li>
							<li>Most valued features typically related to emergency and security</li>
							<li>Most frequently used features related to convenience and maintenance</li>
							<li>For many additional feature engagement occurs once users have used the app for a while</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Project goals and objectives</h3>
						<p>The main goal was to improve the app’s user experience, subsequent objectives were identified with stakeholders when playing back upfront research 
							discoveries. I added further recommendations to objectives where appropriate.</p>
						<div class="sideBySide">

						<h3>Key design challenges</h3>
						<p class="noPadding"><b>Problem: discoverability of frequently used features</b></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Resulting in high frequency Dashboard features encountering low usage</li>
							<li>Assumption that features like vehicle status and vehicle health were unintuitive to access from the main screen</li>
						</ul>
						<div class="imageCaption" style="width : 95%">

						<p class="smallPadding"><br /><b>Improved by:</b> making the summary easier to scan, surfacing more summary information and providing simple access to the whole feature set.</p>
						
						<p class="noPadding"><b><br />Problem: advanced remote perception amongst users was poor due to the features reliability</b></p>
						<ul style="width : 90%;">
							<li>Responsible for 30% of 1-star app ratings alone</li>
							<li>Assumption that this is due to a poor interaction pattern, connection unresponsiveness and the feature disappearing once the trial subscription expires</li>
						</ul>

						<p class="noPadding"><b><br />Problem: users struggle to make a service appointment</b></p>
						<ul style="width : 90%;">
							<li>Resulting in many customers calling Toyota customer service or dealerships to book a service</li>
							<li>Assumption this is due to an overly complicated screen flow with multiple steps making the interaction confusing</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Testing</h3>
						<p>Conducted online unmoderated user tests using a clickable prototype and survey via User Zoom. Prototype included archetypal flows of solutions to identified 
							project objectives, using a mix of existing Toyota app and non-app users.</p>
						
						<!-- <p>Outcome ... </p> -->

						<h3>Summary</h3>
						<p>Following 2 rounds of prototype testing the updated designs were committed to the in-market design system and product squads applied these updates to their respective areas.</p>

						<h2>Companion App Future vision</h2>
						<h3>Background</h3>
						<p class="noPadding">Product research identified 5 focus areas where a step change could give the app a clear purpose in the Toyota 
						ecosystem. I was tasked with creating a future vision for 2 of these:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Safety & Security</b> - keep the user’s vehicle safe and secure at all times, providing assistance in case of emergency</li>
							<li><b>Navigation</b> - plan user’s road trips and locate their parked vehicle, even in congested parking lots</li>
						</ul>
						<div class="sideBySide">
							<div class="flex-item-left"><img src="toyota/DesignBriefFindMyVehicle.png" style="width: 100%" /></div>
							<div class="flex-item-right"><p><b>Find my vehicle design brief</b></p></div>
						</div>
						<br />
						<h3>Research</h3>
						<p>I used existing research to identify a design brief for all features inside an area. Summarising what was already known, what we wanted to understand and defining the 
						opportunity.<br />Competitor design research and benchmarking looked at how comparable feature sets are executed by other providers in this space and also any emergent design standards. While also taking inspiration from indirect competitors that offered similar utilities such as; maps, wayfinding and home security.</p>

							<p><b>Industry design research</b> - Focused on key features and UI patterns</p>
						</div>
						<br />
						<h3>Design hypothesis visiontype</h3>
						<p>Identified solutions as a series of hypotheses for each feature and evolved into a concept as an interaction storyboard.</p>
						<div class="sideBySide" style="width : 100%;">
							<div class="flex-item-left"><img src="toyota/Hypothesis.png" style="width: 100%" /></div>

						<h3>Concept testing</h3>
						<p>Aimed to understand more about a customer's context for each focus area. And gather opinions on the relevancy of each solution for a given situation. Comprising 
						of a survey to explore feature context, situation, frequency and solutions/workarounds used. And a series of tasks to complete using the Visiontype as a click-through prototype.</p>
