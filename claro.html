									<h1>Financial coaching service launch</h1>
									<p>Claro Wellbeing is addressing the financial advice gap in the UK where under 10% of adults are able to obtain financial advice. Financial Coaching is believed to be an accessible alternative regardless of people’s situation.</p>
									<h3>My role</h3>
									<p>Establish an initial service proposition, evolve a product from MVP to launch, build out a small design team and establish a design process.</p>

								<h2>Outcome</h2>
								<p class="noPadding"><b>Multi-channel service launch</b> - the product was released on the app store in 9
								months from defining an initial value proposition. 3 months after launch, the service achieved:</p>
								<UL class="noPadding">
									<li><b>40,000+ users</b></li>
									<li><b>£2-3 million invested</b> through the app into Claros's ESG funds</li>
									<li><b>Conducted 1.5k coaching sessions</b></li>
								</UL>
								<p><b>Scaled into B2B offering</b> - as a Financial Wellbeing benefit to company employees to provide financial coaching, education and tools.</p>

								<h2>Pilot Test</h2>
								<h3>Service prototype</h3>
								<p class="noPadding">The purpose of the pilot was to:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>A low correlation between ‘must-have’ features and actual usage.</li>
									<li>The highest valued features typically relate to emergency and security feature areas</li>
									<li>The highest frequently used features were related more to convenience and maintenance</li>
									<li>Create a service prototype to test with target customers</li>
									<li>Uncover insights on customer value, the propensity to pay expectations and needs for initial customer journey stages</li>
									<li>Validate assumptions made to inform the experience of the pilot</li>
								</ul>
								<p>We defined an initial service offering using existing research findings and conducting an empathy mapping exercise with a financial advisor. These were treated as initial hypotheses to inform the experience design and validated 
								<br />as part of the pilot. This was prototyped using a ‘Wizard of Oz’ approach, using: Calendly, cashflow tool trial, Zoom and a Financial Advisor to conduct coaching calls.</p>

								<h3>Findings</h3>
								<p class="noPadding"><b>New customer segment identified</b></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Had already achieved some long-term financial goals (purchasing a property) and now focusing on additional life goals (wealth planning)</li>
									<li>Their main goal regarding coaching was that they were considering parting ways with their financial advisor due to fees, a percentage of assets each year. Feeling they could make wealth decisions themselves instead of being led.</li>
									<li>Wanting a more ‘casual’ relationship with a financial advisor to help with specific goals when required. To work through their decision, be a 2nd opinion and answer specific questions.</li>

								<h2><br />Beta Launch</h2>
								<h3>End-to-end journey design and longitudinal study</h3>
								<p>User journey from app download, attending a coaching session, to starting a financial goal with Claro. Capturing feedback from 20 beta users via a series of micro-surveys & 1 to 1 interviews over a 4-week period.</p>
								<div class="imageCaption">
									<img src="images/claro/InitialCustomerJourney.png" style="width: 100%; border : 1px solid #cccccc" />

									<p><b>Visual design for beta release</b> - first opportunity to apply new brand and design system to entire customer journey</p>
								</div>
								<h3>Study findings</h3>
								<ul>
									<li><b>Some journey stages progress slowly</b> - most users need time to set up financial goals after a coaching session. Over many weeks whereas the assumption had been this would typically be instantaneous.</li>
									<li><b>Users had low awareness of Claro products</b> - after coaching sessions, many users didn’t realise they could start financial goals with a Claro product. Even though products were associated with a session. Possibly due to coaches only being able to guide decisions but not decide for them.</li>
									<li><b>Customise coaching sessions</b> - experienced users already knew about some coaching session topics. Some wanted to complete specific activities separately and focus the session on priorities, or high-value topics such as investing.</li>
									<li><b>People more likely to progress when a goal was already identified</b> - when a financial goal had already been identified by users they typically had higher engagement levels. Which meant they were more likely to move quickly from an initial coaching session to start to work towards that goal.</li>
								</ul>

								<h2><br />Post Launch Optimisation</h2>
								<h3>PROBLEM : Users not preparing for coaching sessions</h3>
								<p class="noPadding">Post-launch coaching session feedback identified that around a 3rd of users weren’t fully preparing for coaching sessions, and some users weren’t even attending the 
								sessions booked.<br />Impact:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Coaches can’t fully prepare and deliver a complete session plan</li>
									<li>Customer value for coaching outcomes is lowered</li>
									<li>Session rescheduling or no attendance impacts coach utilisation rates</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>Hypothesis</h3>
								<p>After further analysis we formed a solution hypothesis: If users can reach their first milestone of creating a financial plan. They’ll be more accountable to progress, attend coaching sessions and act upon recommendations.</p>
								<div class="imageCaption">
									<img src="images/claro/JourneyWorkingCanvas.png" style="width: 100%; border : 1px solid #cccccc" />
									<p><b>Journey update working canvas</b> - included design research and existing insights relevant to frame Ideas. Focusing on how to engage users through long flows that request lots of data and on sensitive topics like personal finance. Human behaviour assumptions were identified against design research.<!-- and further concepts created.--></p>
								</div>

								<h3>Concept</h3>
								<p class="noPadding">To get users to reach their first milestone the onboarding & schedule session user journey was updated.<br />Main ideas applied:</p> 
								<ul>
									<li>Front-load coaching session preparation - moved to earlier in the journey, mostly before booking a coach</li>
									<li>Leverage internal triggers - use cues that prompt users to take action based on their emotions or existing habits</li>
									<li>Accommodate different starting points - help to identify financial goals, or if known start working through them</li>
									<li>Personalised financial plan and rewards - use the endowment effect to increase the perceived value of a financial plan a user has started creating.</li>
								</ul>
								<div class="imageCaption">
									<img src="images/claro/JourneyPrototype.png" style="width: 90%" />
									<p><b>Journey prototype</b> - 2 versions of the onboarding journey were created to explore divergent approaches for interaction models, engagement techniques around financial goals, motivation and reward techniques.</p>
								</div>
<br />
								<h3>Comparative test</h3>
								<p>Remote unmoderated testing with 35 candidates across 2 prototypes was conducted to collect data on task performance, SUS (System Usability Score) and survey to capture user motivations and preferences.</p> 
								
								<h3>Findings</h3>
								<p class="smallPadding"><b>Building a financial plan in a user-preferred order achieved more task completions.</b> Choosing a financial goal that was very important to them provided motivation to complete aspects, perceived as, less relevant.</p>
								<p class="noPadding"><b>The majority appreciated creating a financial plan required extensive data capture</b>, but still felt that the journey was too long. With a recommendation to:</p>
								<ul class="smallPadding">
									<li>Shift attitudes from data capture steps to creating a plan</li>
									<li>Decompose the journey into obvious chunks that aren't just about answering questions.</li>
								</ul>
								<p class="smallPadding"><b>Candidates were split across the rewards to receive</b> by completing the financial plan.</p>
								<p><b>Candidates earlier in their financial journey obtained more value</b> from using the prototype and were also more engaged. These typically knew less about financial planning or hadn’t identified their goals yet.</p>
