						<b><br />PILOT STAGE</b>
						<h2>Approach</h3>
						<p>Initial service offering was defined using existing research findings and conducted a generative empathy mapping exercise with a financial 
							advisor to inform the experience design. These were treated as initial hypotheses and validated as part of the pilot.<br />The service 
							prototype was created using a Wizard of Oz approach using: Calendly, a cashflow tool trial, Zoom and a Financial Advisor to conduct coaching calls.</p>
						<h3>Testing a service prototype</h3>
						<p class="noPadding">Pilot purpose:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Create a service prototype to test with target customers</li>
							<li>Uncover insights on customer value, the propensity to pay expectations and needs for initial customer journey stages</li>
							<li>Validate assumptions made to inform the experience of the pilot</li>

							<li>Wanting a more ‘casual’ relationship with a financial advisor to help with specific goals when required. To work through their decision, be a second opinion and answer specific questions</li>

						<h3>Study findings</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Some journey stages progress slowly</b> - most users needed time to set up financial goals after a coaching session. Over many weeks whereas the assumption had been this would typically be instantaneous</li>
							<li><b>Users had low awareness of Claro products</b> - after coaching sessions, many users didn’t realise they could start financial goals with a Claro product. Even though products were associated with a session. Possibly due to coaches only being able to guide decisions but not decide for them</li>
							<li><b>Customise coaching sessions</b> - experienced users already knew about some coaching session topics. Some wanted to complete specific activities separately and focus the session on priorities, or high-value topics such as investing</li>
							<li><b>People more likely to progress when a goal was already identified</b> - when a financial goal had already been identified by users they typically had higher engagement levels. Which meant they were more likely to move quickly from an initial coaching session to start to work towards that goal</li>
						</ul>

						<b>POST LAUNCH OPTIMISATION</b>
						<h2>PROBLEM : Users not preparing for coaching sessions</h2>
						<p class="noPadding">Post-launch coaching session feedback identified that around a third of users weren’t fully preparing for coaching sessions, and some users weren’t even attending the 
						sessions booked.<br />Impact:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Coaches can’t fully prepare and deliver a complete session plan</li>
							<li>Customer value for coaching outcomes is lowered</li>
							<li>Session rescheduling or no attendance impacts coach utilisation rates</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Hypothesis</h3>
						<p>After further analysis we formed a solution hypothesis: If users can reach their first milestone of creating a financial plan. They’ll be more accountable to progress, attend coaching sessions and act upon recommendations.</p>
						<div class="imageCaption">
							<img class="drop" src="images/claro/JourneyWorkingCanvas.png" style="width: 100%;" />
							<p><b>Journey update working canvas</b> - included competitor design research, existing insights and relevant human behaviour assumptions to frame Ideas.</p>
						</div>

						<h3>Concept</h3>
						<p class="noPadding">Focused on how to engage users through a long journey sequence that request lots of data and covers sensitive topics like personal finance. Main ideas applied:</p> 
						<ul>
							<li><b>Front-load coaching session preparation</b> - moving it earlier in the journey, mostly before booking a coach</li>
							<li><b>Leverage internal triggers</b> - using cues to prompt action based on emotions or existing habits</li>
							<li><b>Accommodate different starting points</b> - help to identify financial goals, or if known start working through them</li>
							<li><b>Personalised financial plan and rewards</b> - use the endowment effect to increase perceived value of a financial plan</li>
						</ul>
						<div class="imageCaption">
							<img src="images/claro/JourneyPrototype.png" style="width: 90%" />
							<p><b>Journey prototype</b> - 2 versions of the onboarding journey were created to explore divergent approaches for interaction models, engagement techniques around financial goals, motivation and reward techniques.</p>
						</div>
						<br />
						<h3>Comparative test</h3>
						<p>Remote unmoderated testing with 35 candidates across 2 prototypes was conducted to collect data on task performance, SUS (System Usability Score) and survey to capture user motivations and preferences.</p> 
						
						<h3>Findings</h3>
						<p class="smallPadding"><b>Building a financial plan in a user-preferred order achieved more task completions.</b> Choosing a financial goal that was very important provided motivation to also complete aspects of tthe journey perceived as less relevant.</p>
						<p class="noPadding"><b>The majority appreciated creating a financial plan required extensive data capture</b>, but still felt that the journey was too long. With a recommendation to:</p>
						<ul class="smallPadding">
							<li>Shift attitudes from data capture steps to creating a plan</li>
							<li>Decompose the journey into obvious chunks that aren't just about answering questions.</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="smallPadding"><b>Candidates were split across the rewards to receive</b> by completing the financial plan.</p>
						<p><b>Candidates earlier in their financial journey obtained more value</b> from using the prototype and were also more engaged. These typically knew less about financial planning or hadn’t identified their goals yet.</p>
