					<h2>Background</h2>
					<p>Aioi Nissay Dowa Europe (AND-E) alongside partner Toyota Finance had identified an opportunity for business customers to be 
						offered a lightweight fleet management capability as part of their insurance package. An alternative to purchasing a dedicated fleet management product.</p>
					<p>Adapting an existing telematics consumer proposition to monitor driver performance, car maintenance and 
						compliance. A dashboard had been designed by the telematics development team with an existing consumer 
						app adapted for a b2b context. </p>
					<p>A pilot with a client had recieved poor user feedback, the ask was for me to come in and 'fix the UI'. I was conscious more 
						understanding was required of target users than just executing an improved UI, making the case to understand more about the user’s situations before design work started.</p>
						
					<h2>Research</h2>
					<p>I conducted initial field studies with a client trialling the tool, a b2b auto parts supplier. I interviewed two fleet managers 
						and conducted a cognitive walkthrough of their main tasks while using the tool. Unfortunately, it wasn’t possible to chat 
						with drivers, so I used anecdotal information from the fleet managers initially and treated these as assumptions to be validated.</p>

					<p>I decided there wasn’t a need to measure the current tool’s performance to justify improvements, as the focus was to generate 
						a current understanding of how people do their jobs and identify opportunities to make the system more appropriate.</p>

					<h3>Personas</h3>
					
					<p>Initial sessions with the product team demonstrated that there wasn’t a collective understanding of business goals or user insight. 
						Some concepts were being communicated inconsistently. I therefore created key personas to synthesise findings of the field study into 
						a simple format of headlines for the team to use as guidance.</p>

					<h2>Design</h2>
					
					<h3>Fleet manager dashboard</h3>
					<p class="noPadding">The approach for the initial release was to create a simple UI, establishing a foundation to extend in future releases.<br />
						Main changes included:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Reducing UI flexibility as customisation options easily made the tool hard to use. Creating a screen architecture for primary data groupings that could be easily navigated via multiple entry points</li>
						<li>Apply an F-shaped reading pattern to the screen structure to improve scannability. Creating a series of rows for ‘at a glance’ behaviour exhibited by fleet managers - as they switch between systems and views</li>
						<li>Some data-heavy UI hygiene:<br />
							- Comprehension of field labels: re-wording or decomposing into field value suffix<br />
							- Standardised visuals & icons to work across dashboard and mobile<br />
							- Round up numbers - multiple decimal places not needed by users<br />
							</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Driver's mobile app</h3>
					<p>The team decided to make the drivers portal a web-based solution as the field study identified drivers using both Android and iPhones with some having 
						older devices to be supported. The working hypothesis for a driver’s main information needs was ‘how I’ve driven today’, how I’ve driven this week’ 
						or ‘have I driven badly’.</p>

					<br />
					<h2>Testing</h2>
					<p>Dashboard and mobile designs were tested via remote cognitive walkthroughs with fleet managers, using a mid-fidelity clickable prototype. Key 
						scenarios previously identified guided the session using a semi-structured ‘test’ to gather opinions on assumed user’s comprehension and usability.</p>
