									<li>By 2023 <b style="font-size : 110%">300,000+ users</b> in over 100 countries use the platform</li>
									<!-- <li><b style="font-size : 110%">6000+ documents</b> (climate laws, policies and submissions) are fully searchable and auto-translated to English from all languages</li> -->
									<li>Can search through <b>half a million pages</b> of national climate laws, policies and UNFCCC submissions from national governments, translated into english</li>
									<!--
									<li>A simple way to search the full text of 5000+ </li>
									<li>Provides an effective way of working for researchers to preview search matches to understand the context and direct access to original documents</li>

					<h2>Background</h2>
					<p>An initial alpha product had been created by a data science and development team proving that the technology could work. With 
						limited user discoveries incorporated into the design process. Relying instead on first-hand experiences, collective assumptions amongst the team and best endeavours UI design work.</p>
					
					<h2>Establishing a user research strategy</h2>
					<p>Some team members had a broad research background and strong opinions but limited access to actual users to understand their context and obtain feedback. 
						Relying on ad-hoc, limited access to peers in the wider community, with no formal user engagement process established.</p>
					
					<h3>Initial goals</h3>
					<!-- <p class="noPadding">Key goals for initial user research:</p> -->
					<ul>
						<li>Understand the type of work users do (e.g. a policymaker, an academic)</li>
						<li>What questions are they trying to answer</li>
						<li>How they work and where they encounter challenges</li>
						<li>What could make the tools more useful to them</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h3>Discoveries</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Users are typically knowledge workers who need to answer research questions as part of their jobs</li>
						<li>Their roles includes civil servant policy analysts, NGO researchers, PhD students, risk modellers and scientific advisors</li>
						<li>Problems encountered are <b>limited time available</b> to conduct research, having to <b>consult multiple sources</b> and <b>manually extract data</b> from long 
							policy documents that are <b>written in multiple languages</b></li> 
						<li>Preparing for key events, like the annual COP summit, hundreds of documents are released just before the event that need synthesising quickly</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Created personas to provide focus</h3>
					<p class="noPadding">Many user types were identified, to provide focus I grouped each by similar needs and goals into 2 main 
						personas: Researcher and Political Decision-Maker.
						<br />This overcame challenges encountered regarding: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Multiple user types to consider when designing </li>
						<li>Mixed opinions amongst the team about who the users were and their needs</li>
						<li>A stanrdard means of communication: internally amongst the project team and externally with partners</li>
					</ul>

						<img class="drop" src="images/cpr/PoliticalDecisionMaker.png" style="width : 90%;" />

					<h3>Establishing a user community</h3>
					<p>Alpha users were encouraged to register for early access and then contacted about their experiences. After launch, everybody who gets in contact (i.e. submit law or policy documents, request 
						data set download) is invited to join a user feedback session. And then invited to join a community, providing easy access to the user base to conduct research studies or to ask quick tactical questions.</p>

					<h3>Making research a team effort</h3>
					<p>As user engagement need to continue beyond my availability the product team would need to execute aspects of user research.<br />
						Key activities that helped:

					<br /><b>Monitor interviewers performance</b> to improve performance interviewers reviewed their sessions at the end. With session notes template included a checklist 
						of things that the interviewer should avoid. Things like “don’t ask leading questions” and “don’t ask yes/no questions”.
					
					<br /><b>Share findings</b> every user conversation required a one-page summary including key insights and opportunities for improvement. Available for the whole team 
						to view and learn from. Fortnightly team sessions shared learnings from user research with the whole team. </p>

					<h2>Design</h2>
					<p>COMING SOON ... waiting on agreement with CPR what can be shared as some work is not yet released. </p>

						information for key personas.</p>

					<h3>Tracked in google analytics</h3>
					<p class="noPadding">Using a combination of standard out-the-box and customised tracking measurements</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Engagement stage</b> - looking at interaction with text passages matching search criteria, viewing documents or downloading the original document. Customised 
							to measure interaction with physical document pages and variables on detail pages to understand how document types perform</li>
						<li><b>Recurrence stage</b> - how many users return and perform specific actions (i.e. searching, viewing document passages) on original and repeat visits. Assuming 
							they’ve found enough value in the tool to return and use it again</li>
