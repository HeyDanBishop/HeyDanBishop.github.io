					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<UL>
						<li>Beta launch of tool for public access</li>
						<li>A simple way to search the full text of 5000+ climate laws, policies and submissions</li>
						<li>Improves accessibility of documents in all languages, auto-translated into English</li>
						<!-- <li>Provides an effective way of working for researchers to preview search matches to understand the context and direct access to original documents</li> -->
						<li>User engagement framework established and incorporated into CPRs product development process</li>
					</UL>

					<br />
					<h2>Background</h2>
					<p>An initial alpha product had been created by a data science & development team proving that the technology could work. With 
						limited user discoveries incorporated into the design process. Relying instead on first-hand experiences, collective assumptions amongst the team and best endeavours UI design work.</p>
					
					<h2>Research</h2>
					<p>The discovery tool was built using assumptions about target users and the solutions that would help them. Some team members had a 
						broad research background and strong opinions but limited access to actual users to understand their context and obtain feedback. 
						Relying on ad-hoc, limited access to peers in the wider community, with no formal user engagement process established.</p>
					
					<h3>Goals</h3>
					<p class="noPadding">Key goals for initial user research:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Understand the type of work they do (e.g. are they a policymaker or academic etc)</li>
						<li>The questions they’re trying to answer</li>
						<li>How they work and where they encounter challenges</li>
						<li>What could make the tools more useful to them</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h3>Discoveries</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Users are typically knowledge workers who need to answer research questions as part of their jobs</li>
						<li>Their roles includes civil servant policy analysts, NGO researchers, PhD students, risk modellers and scientific advisors</li>
						<li>Problems encountered are <b>limited time available</b> to conduct research, having to <b>consult multiple sources</b> and <b>manually extract data</b> from long 
							policy documents that are <b>written in multiple languages</b></li> 
						<li>Preparing for key events, like the annual COP summit, hundreds of documents are released just before the event that need synthesising quickly, reducing time available even more</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Created personas to provide focus</h3>
					<p class="noPadding">Many user types were identified from the initial research, to provide focus I grouped each by similar needs & goals into 2 main personas: a Researcher 
						and a Political Decision-Maker.
						<br />This overcame challenges encountered reagrding: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Multiple user types to cosnider when designing </li>
						<li>Mixed opinions amongst the team about who the users were and their needs</li>
						<li>A stanrdard means of communication: internally amongst the projecty team and externally with partners etc</li>
					</ul>

						<br /><br />
						<img class="drop" src="images/cpr/PoliticalDecisionMaker.png" style="width : 90%; border : 1px solid #cccccc" />
						<p><br /><b>Key personas</b> - 2 main user types were identified that had differing behaviours & levels of engagement.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="imageCaption">
						<img class="drop" src="images/cpr/ResearchersUser Journey.png" style="width : 90%; border : 1px solid #cccccc" />
						<p><br /><b>User journey</b> - User Journey maps identified current experiences and provided a basis to collectively discuss and decide upon opportunities to improve the experience for each Persona.</p>
					</div>

					<br />
					<h3>Establishing a user community</h3>
					<p>Alpha users were encouraged to register for early access and then contacted about their experiences. After launch, every user who gets in contact (i.e. submit law or policy documents, request data set download) is invited to join a user feedback session 
						initially. And then invited to join a community, providing easy access to the user base to conduct research studies or to ask quick tactical questions.</p>

					<h3>Making research a team effort</h3>
					<p>As user engagement would need to continue beyond my availability the product team would need to execute aspects of user research.<br />
						Key activities that helped:

					<!-- <p><b>Training</b> - How to train them up</p>-->

					
					<br /><b>Monitor interviewers performance</b> - to improve performance interviewers reviewed their sessions at the end. With session notes template included a checklist 
						of things that the interviewer should avoid. Things like “don’t ask leading questions” and “don’t ask yes/no questions”.
					
					<br /><b>Share findings</b> - every user conversation required a one-page summary including key insights and opportunities for improvement. Available for the whole team 
						to view and learn from. Fortnightly team sessions shared learnings from user research with the whole team. </p>

					<br />
					<h2>Design</h2>
					<p>COMING SOON ... waiting on agreement with CPR what can be shared as some is not yet released. </p>
					
					<br />
					<h2>Ongoing journey management</h2>

					<h3>User lifecycle</h3>
					<p>Identified current understanding of how the tool was being used, applying both persona’s context to a typical product usage lifecycle. </p>
					<div class="imageCaption">
						<img class="drop" src="images/cpr/UseLifecycle.png" style="width : 90%; border : 1px solid #cccccc" />
						<p><br /><b>User Lifecycle</b> - identifies how the tool is being used, highlighting when high-value actions are performed and also potential drops in engagement.</p>
					</div>

					<h3>Tracked in google analytics</h3>
					<p class="noPadding">This was then tracked with Google Analytics using a combination of standard out-the-box and customised tracking.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Engagement stage</b> - measured by looking at interaction with text passages matching search criteria, viewing documents or downloading the original document. This required custom tracking to measure interaction with physical document pages and variables on detail pages to understand how document types performed</li>
						<li><b>Recurrence stage</b> - measured by tracking how many users return and perform specific actions (i.e. searching, viewing document passages) on original and repeat visits. With the assumption that they’ve found enough value in the tool to return and use it again</li>
					</ul>
