						<h2>Background</h2>
							<p>Insure The Box (ITB) was an early arrival in telematics insurance and now finds itself in a busy market with competition who have appealing propositions, better 
								reputations and customer satisfaction. Anyone can now enter the market with an ‘Off the Shelf’ telematics solution. For example, <a href="https://www.thefloow.com/our-solutions/floowdrive-with-floowfusion/" 
								target="_blank">FloowDrive</a> can package 5 years of telematics expertise into a quick-to-deploy white-label solution and be up and running within hours.</p>

							<p>As markets are becoming more competitive products and services are differentiating to survive with a vast majority using customer experience to compete in 
								the ‘Experience Economy’. ITB ranks poorly on the quality of its customer experience on external customer review sites.</p>
						
						<br />
						<h2>Discovery</h2>
						<p>Customer perspective was formed initially from trawling social content around telematics, customer call listening and service agent interviews. To inform a topic structure for one-to-one conversations with current 
							or recent ITB customers.<br /><br />Stakeholder engagement identified their perspective on 
							customers, surfacing 'some' KPI’s, team goals, uncovering related initiatives and motivations for improvement.</p>
						<div class="imageCaption">

							<p><b>Stakeholder & Service Advisor workshops</b> - explored the problem space in a series of<br />
								semi-structured interviews & workshops sessions.</p>

						<h2><br />Persona creation</h2>
						<p>From engaging with parts of the business it was evident that there was little understanding of who the customers are beyond key KPIs. Many had not spoken 
							directly to customers or engaged in customer research with the customer’s voice not widely represented in initiatives.</p>
						<!--
						<p> working with the Product Manager, to conduct sessions with service advisors and refine assumptions. The emerging 
							themes were validated with the data insights team to align with a statistical representation.</p>

						<p>initial sessions with service agents gave a further understanding of the types of customers they deal with and the techniques 
							used to identify them and adapt their service approach.</p>

							<p><b>Service Advisor and business insights workshops</b> - useful to initially refine assumptions into emerging <br />themes and then validated with a statistical representation.</p>
							<img src="images/andie/Personas.png" style="width : 90%"/>
							<p><b>Customer personas</b> - identified 4 main customers across all telematic brands, <br />making up 95% of the customer base.</p>
						</div>

						<p style="text-align : center; border-top : 1px solid #cccccc; border-bottom : 1px solid #cccccc; padding-bottom : 20px; padding-top : 15px;"><b>Outcome</b><br />Moved the customer perspective beyond just key KPI's such as No Claims Discount. <br />
							To include driver life-stage, needs relating to knowledge and experience in car insurance, attitudes towards contract responsibilities and ability to interact with organisations.</p>

						<br />
						<b>LIFECYCLE: ACQUISITION</b>
						<h2>Discoveries</h2>
						<p class="noPadding">Key findings identified:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Brand and telematics proposition is poorly communicated</li>
							<li>Customers don’t feel comfortable purchasing from ITB because they don’t trust the website</li>
							<li>ITB have to compete based on reputation more than larger, recognised brands</li>
							<li>Most look on review sites because they didn’t recognise ITB </li>
							<li>Prospects via pricing aggregators encounter most challenges in their onward journey</li>
							<li>Broad variations in policyholders insurance knowledge (typically from years driving or situations encountered)</li>
							<li>New driver parents are heavily involved with policy management decisions</li>
						</ul>

						<H2>Optimisation Strategy</H2>

						<p>Optimisation strategy identified must-have hygiene features for an acquisition journey and a series of further experiment opportunities.</p>
						<div class="imageCaption">
							<img src="images/andie/OptimisationPlan.png" style="width: 90%" />
							<p><b>Optimisation strategy</b> - identified baseline improvements & potential opportunities to explore.</p>

						<div class="imageCaption">
							<img src="images/andie/OptimisationWall.png" style="width: 90%; border-color : 1px solid #cccccc;" />
							<p><b>Design wall</b> - allowed easy mapping of findings, design evolutions & evaluative feedback.</p>
						</div>

						<br />

						<div class="imageCaption">
							<img src="images/andie/AcquisitionVisuals.png" style="width: 90%; border-color : 1px solid #cccccc;" />
							<p><b>Updated designs for quote & buy journey</b> - working alongside Content Specialist and Visual Designer to overhaul the product landing page and enhancements to policy 
								quote and buy steps.</p>
						</div>

						<p><b>Improve telematics policy comprehension</b><br />
							Customer research identified that providers offered differing ‘flavours’ of telematics policy. This inconsistency was confusing for customers as it could incur penalties if usage rules were violated.<br />
							Creating a negative dynamic with customers who felt unfairly treated and a bad reputation for ITB with poor customer reviews.<br />
							To improve policy comprehension for prospects and policyholders, clarify how black box insurance works and ITB’s stance on policy usage such as curfews, limited mileage and rewards.</p>

						<p><b>Improving trust of digital touchpoints</b><br />
							Customer research had identified that the digital touchpoints didn’t enact trust in prospects and customers. due to a series of factors (see survey). This also aligned with customer testing findings that identified challenges completing this journey on mobile - approx 60% of acquisition traffic at this time.<br />
							The assumption is that these factors contributed to the reduction of prospects successfully progressing through the acquisition journey.<br />
							To improve the trust of site visitors, a contemporary visual treatment was applied, utilising references to parent organisations ANDIE, Toyota and updating mobile design patterns with benchmarked best practice techniques to reduce the challenges faced in completing extensive data capture forms.</p>
						
						
						<p style="text-align : center; border-top : 1px solid #cccccc; border-bottom : 1px solid #cccccc; padding-bottom : 20px; padding-top : 15px;"><b>Outcome</b><br />Updating the landing 
							page and the 'must have' updates for quote & buy steps created <br />an <b style="font-size : 115%;">uplift in policy conversions of 56%</b> through online for its first 3 months of being live.</P>
						
						<br />
						<b>LIFECYCLE: POLICY USE</b>
						<h2>Discoveries</h2>
						<p class="noPadding">Identified key journey moments to focus on a new experience vision, main issues included:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Disjointed experience with ITB partners especially box installation and finance provider creating a bad impression in the first days of the policy</li>
							<li>Customer data integrity issues that fundamentally affect communications and ongoing engagement with policyholders</li>
							<li>Low customer portal engagement and limited self-serve capabilities</li>
							<li>Misunderstanding of hidden fees causes customer stress and annoyance</li>
							<li>The claims process is difficult for a new driver to be effective</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>Service vision scenarios</h2>
						<p>Each key moment was framed for ideation by identifying a goal, discoveries and context from initial research and opportunities to improve the current as-is experience.</p>
						
						<div class="imageCaption" style="width : 100%;">
							<img class="drop" src="images/andie/DesignFramingNew.png" style="width: 90%;" style="width: 90%;" />
							<p><b>Design framing for accident claim key moment</b> - aligning an overarching goal with relevant context discoveries (business, customer, technology) and

							<img class="drop" src="images/andie/ScenarioStoryboardNew.png" style="width: 90%;" />
							<p><b>Scenario storyboard for accident claim key moment</b> - selected ideas were formed into a scenario to communicate a vision for how the experience would occur.</p>
						</div>
						
						<br />
						<p style="text-align : center; border-top : 1px solid #cccccc; padding-top : 15px;"><b>Outcome</b><br />Scenarios formed key parts of the service vision for a customer portal and 
							policyholder engagement.<br />This also informed a further phase of customer research to gather perspectives on assumed attitudes and needs.</p>
