							<h2>Outcome</h2>
							<UL>
								<li>Discovery of insights to shape ‘To Be’ and future state visions of the health assessment experience</li>
								<li>Updated designs included clear pathways for all user types at key stages of their health journey and across digital & human touchpoints</li>
								<!--	to incorporate discoveries and over-arching design direction</li> -->
							</UL>
							<div class="imageCaption" style="width : 100%;">
								<img src="images/bupa/Hero.png" style="width: 100%;" />
								<p><b>New health assessments landing page</b></p>
							</div>
							<br />
							<h2>Background</h2>
							<p>There was no holistic understanding of the customer's healthcare experience, with silo reporting that focused on key parts of the 
								customer’s lifecycle. A recent member survey found that 65% of survey respondents found it difficult to choose a health assessment.</p>
							
							<h2>Research</h2>
							<p>Conducted discovery via web analytics, call centre listening, stakeholder interviews and assessment centre visits to observe and interview 
								customers and health centre teams.</p>
							<!--
							<div class="imageCaption">
								<img src="images/times/findings.png" style="width: 90%;"/>
								<p><br /><b>Research findings report</b> - summary of participants reactions to concepts & key recommendations.</p>
							</div>
							<br />
							-->
							<h3>Discoveries</h3>
							<p><b>Customer findings</b> - the key differentiator between the main customer types was if they received a health assessment as an employee benefit or were paying for 
								it themselves. This influenced their behaviour and expectations of having a health assessment.</p>
							<div class="imageCaption">
								<img src="images/bupa/Personas.png" style="width : 90%" />
								<p><br /><b>Customer proto personas</b> - 2 main customer types were identified that<br />had differing behaviours & levels of engagement.</p>
							</div>
							<h3>Journey stage: Acquisition</h3>
							<p><b>High self funders engagement before an assessment</b> - corporate employees aren't typically involved in choosing their health assessment or booking a 
								visit. and also that assessment information was available on their company's intranet.
								<br /><b>Challenges with product comparison & selection</b> - site analytics identified visitors looping around products and section pages accessing the same pages. Call 
								centre listening identified struggles finding and understanding site content, with the helpline fielding specific questions about assessments & centre visits.</p>
							<p></p>

							<h3>Journey stage: Health assessment</h3>
							<b>Situations were occurring that affected perceived value of an assessment.</b>
							<br /><b>Visitors were not prepared for assessments</b> - ignoring dietary requests, not bringing sports clothing and not preparing questions for the assessment team. Visitors 
								had either forgotten or weren’t aware this was required of them.
							<br />
							<b>Post-assessment support is valued, but not always utilised</b> - talking through assessment outcomes with a doctor and ongoing support are rated highly. Though aspects of the 
								post-assessment service are under-utilised, even though it’s a key differentiator between Bupa & competitors.</p>
							<div class="imageCaption">
								<img src="images/bupa/Experience-map.png" style="width : 90%; border : 1px solid #c6c6c6;" />
								<p><b>Experience map highlights</b> - Customer lifecycle pain point themes were broken down for<br />discoveries to be presented back to various teams.</p>
							</div>
							<br />
							<h2>Design</h2>
							<h3>New IA</h3>
							<p class="noPadding">Combining a series of recommendations from the wider site redesign and discoveries from health assessment research:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Simplified access points aligned to the assessment lifecycle</li>
								<li>Effective navigation for direct SERP access or via the homepage</li>
								<li>Prioritised self-funded consumer journeys, as the majority of site visitors</li>
							</ul>
							<div class="imageCaption">
								<img class="drop" src="images/bupa/IA-redesign.png" style="width : 90%; border : 1px solid #c6c6c6;"" />
								<p><b>Revised IA</b> - to provide focused entry points for visitors need states & simplified content organisation to remove comprehension & navigation challenges encountered.</p>
							</div>
							<br />
							<h3>Choose an assessment</h3>
							<p class="noPadding">Assisting site visitors in choosing an appropriate assessment with a simplified approach to comparing options, which included: </p>
							<ul>
								<li>Revised package names that have meaning and are relevant as a set</li>
								<li>Surfacing headline attributes: assessment duration, number of tests in total and by category and time spent with the doctor</li>
								<li>Who the test is suitable for and what you’ll understand from it</li>
							</ul>
							<div class="imageCaption">
								<img src="images/bupa/Idea-scamp.png" style="width : 90%" />
								<p><b>Concept design Assessment select & configure</b> - simplified & prominent metadata, alternative discovery mechanisms & basic triage/ finder to identify their assessment needs.</p>
							</div>
							<!--
							<h3><br />Future stage concepts</h3>
							<p class="noPadding">Combined discoveries with technology advancements to influence evolving customer needs, to consider:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>How a customer's mobile phone could raise engagement with the Corporate Benefit persona prior to the assessment visit</li>
								<li>Using video calls and account profiles could reduce barriers to accessing follow-up sessions with health professionals and make plans more dynamic as progress is made. Raising 
									the value perception of assessment products</li>
