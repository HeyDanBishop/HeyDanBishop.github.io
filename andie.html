						<h2>Background</h2>
							<p>Insure The Box (ITB) was an early arrival in telematics insurance and now finds itself in a busy market with competition who have appealing propositions, better 
								reputations and customer satisfaction. Anyone can enter the market with an ‘Off the Shelf’ telematics solution. For example, <a href="https://www.thefloow.com/our-solutions/floowdrive-with-floowfusion/" 
								target="_blank">FloowDrive</a> can package 5 years of telematics expertise into a quick-to-deploy white-label solution and be up and running within hours.</p>

							<p>As markets are becoming more competitive products and services are differentiating to survive with a vast majority using customer experience to compete in 
								the ‘Experience Economy’. ITB ranks poorly on the quality of its customer experience on external customer review sites.</p>

						<h2>Discovery</h2>
						<h3>Approach</h3>
						<p>Customer perspective was formed initially from trawling social content around telematics, customer call listening and completing 
							a SUPR-Q survey, aligning statements with a Likert scale. To inform a topic structure for one-to-one conversations with current 
							or recent ITB customers.<br /><br />Stakeholder engagement identified their perspective on 
							customers, surfacing 'some' KPI’s, team goals, uncovering related initiatives and motivations for improvement.</p>

							<p><b>Stakeholder & Service Advisor workshops</b> - explored the problem space in a series of<br />
								semi-structured interviews & workshops sessions.</p>

						<h3>Findings</h3>

						<div class="imageCaption">
							<img src="images/andie/CustomerLifecycle.png" style="width: 99%;" />
							<p><b>As-is customer lifecycle</b> - highlighted key moments and headline discoveries <br />for how the service was performing.</p>

							<div class="flex-item-right"><p><b>Aggregator performance</b> - 80% of traffic comes through Aggregators, ITB are undifferentiated with 
								competitors when not competing on price and people are changing their minds after clicking through to the site.</p></div>

						<h2><br />Persona creation</h2>
						<p>From engaging with parts of the business it was evident that there was little understanding of who the customers are beyond key KPIs. Many had not spoken 
							directly to customers or engaged in customer research with the customer’s voice not widely represented in initiatives.</p>
						<!--
						<p> working with the Product Manager, to conduct sessions with service advisors and refine assumptions. The emerging 
							themes were validated with the data insights team to align with a statistical representation.</p>

						<p>initial sessions with service agents gave a further understanding of the types of customers they deal with and the techniques 
							used to identify them and adapt their service approach.</p>
						-->

						<div class="imageCaption">

							<br />
							<p><b>Service Advisor and Business Insights workshops</b> - useful to initially refine assumptions into emerging <br />themes and then validated with a statistical representation.</p>
							<img src="images/andie/Personas.png" style="width : 90%"/>
							<p><b>Customer personas</b> - identified 4 main customers across all telematic brands, <br />making up 95% of the customer base.</p>
						</div>

						<p style="text-align : center; border-top : 1px solid #cccccc; padding-top : 15px;"><b>Outcome</b><br />Moved the customer perspective beyond just key KPI's such as No Claims Discount. <br />
							To include: Driver life-stage, needs relating to knowledge and experience in car insurance, attitudes towards <br />contract responsibilities and ability to interact with a company such as a service centre team.</p>

						<h2><br />LIFECYCLE STAGE: ACQUISITION</h2>
						<h3>Discovery findings</h3>
						<p class="noPadding">Usability testing, customer surveys & path analysis identified:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Brand and telematics proposition is poorly communicated</li>
							<li>Customers don’t feel comfortable purchasing from ITB because they don’t trust the website</li>
							<li>ITB have to compete based on reputation more than larger, recognised brands</li>
							<li>Most look on review sites because they didn’t recognise ITB </li>
							<li>Prospects via pricing aggregator (80% of traffic) encounter more challenges in their onward journey to purchase</li>
							<li>Broad variations in policyholders insurance knowledge (typically from years driving or situations encountered)</li>
							<li>Parents heavily involved with new drivers when making key decisions and ongoing management of the policy</li>
						</ul>

						<H3>Journey optimisation</H3>

						<p>Optimisation strategy identified must-have hygiene features for an acquisition journey and a series of further experiment opportunities.</p>
						<div class="imageCaption">
							<img src="images/andie/OptimisationPlan.png" style="width: 90%" />
							<p><b>Optimisation strategy</b> - identified baseline improvements & potential opportunities to explore.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="imageCaption">
							<img src="images/andie/OptimisationWall.png" style="width: 90%; border-color : 1px solid #cccccc;" />
							<p><b>Design wall</b> - allowed for easy mapping of key insights, design evolutions & evaluative feedback.</p>
						</div>

						<div class="imageCaption">
							<img src="images/andie/AcquisitionVisuals.png" style="width: 90%; border-color : 1px solid #cccccc;" />
							<p><b>Updated designs for quote & buy journey</b> - working alongside Content Specialist and Visual Designer to overhaul the product landing page and enhancements to policy 
								quote and buy steps.</p>
						</div>

						<p>Early social sentiment analysis discovered that people found key differences in how a telematics policy worked across providers. So we decided to clarify upfront ITB’s stance 
							on topics such as: curfews, limited mileage, rewards etc and information about how Black Box insurance works - useful for comprehension of drivers and parents, if involved 
							in a policy.</p>
						<p>To improve the trust of site visitors, in the short term, a contemporary visual treatment was used with the the mobile design using best practices techniques to reduce the challenges 
							faced completing long forms.</p>
						
						<br />
						<p style="text-align : center; border-top : 1px solid #cccccc; padding-top : 15px;"><b>Outcome</b><br />Updating the landing page and must have updates for quote & buy steps created
						<br />an <b>uplift in policy conversions of 56%</b> through online for its first 3 months of being live.</P>
						
						<br /><br />
						<h2>LIFECYCLE STAGE: POLICY USE</h2>
						<h3>Discovery findings</h3>
						<p class="noPadding">Identified key journey moments to focus on a new experience vision, main issues included:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Disjointed experience with ITB partners especially box installation and finance provider creating a bad impression in the first days of the policy</li>
							<li>Customer data integrity issues that fundamentally affect communications and ongoing engagement with policyholders</li>
							<li>Low customer portal engagement and limited self-serve capabilities</li>
							<li>Misunderstanding of hidden fees causes customer stress and annoyance</li>
							<li>The claims process is difficult for a new driver to be effective</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Problem framing and concept design</h3>
						<p>Each key moment was framed for ideation by identifying a goal, discoveries and context from initial research and opportunities to improve the current as-is experience.</p>
						<div class="imageCaption">
							<img src="images/andie/DesignFraming.png" style="width: 90%;" />
							<p><b>Design framing for accident claim key moment</b> - aligning an overarching goal with relevant context discoveries (business, customer, technology) and 
								interpreted into a series of opportunities as 'How Might We' questions.</p>
						</div>
						<br />

						<div class="imageCaption">
							<img src="images/andie/ScenarioStoryboard.png" style="width: 90%;" />
							<p><b>Scenario storyboard for accident claim key moment</b> - selected ideas were formed into a scenario to communicate a vision for how the experience would occur.</p>
						</div>
						
						<br />
						<p style="text-align : center; border-top : 1px solid #cccccc; padding-top : 15px;"><b>Outcome</b><br />Scenarios formed key parts of the service vision for a customer portal and 
							policyholder engagement.<br />This also informed a further phase of customer research to gather perspectives on assumed attitudes and needs.</p>
