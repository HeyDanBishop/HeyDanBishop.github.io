									<h1>Telematics proposition evolution</h1>
									<p>Insure The Box (ITB) was an early arrival in telematics insurance and now finds itself in a busy market with competition who have appealing propositions, a better reputation and customer satisfaction.</p>
									<h3>My role</h3>

								<h2>Outcome</h2>
								<p class="smallPadding"><b>Customer centricity</b> - moving the internal perspective of policyholders beyond just key data points. To be mindful of typical needs and behaviour associated with a telematics insurance policyholder and life stages.</p>
								<p class="smallPadding"><b>Improvements in acquiring customers</b> - optimisation plan identified must-have design updates and future opportunities for experimentation. Updates to the product section and policy quote/buy steps uplifted policy conversions by 56% in the 3 months after launch.</p>
								<p class="smallPadding"><b>A service vision for policyholders</b> - defining future state scenarios for customer lifecycle key moments. Overcoming current business challenges and ways to better serve policyholders.</p>

								<p class="twoImages"><br /><b>Updated homepage design & future concept for accident claims</b></p>
								<br />

								<h2>Discovery</h2>
								<h3>Research</h3>
								<p>The customer perspective was formed from existing primary research, trawling social content around telematics and customer call listening with service teams. To inform the focus of 1-to-1 interviews with current or recent 
								ITB customers.<br />Stakeholder engagement identified their perspective on customers, motivations for improvement, team goals and uncovering related initiatives.</p>
								
								<div class="imageCaption">
									<img src="images/andie/StakeholderEngagment.png" style="width : 90%" />
									<p><b>Stakeholder & Service Advisor engagement</b> - explored the problem space in a series of<br />
										semi-structured interviews & workshops sessions.</p>
								</div>
								<br />
								<div class="sideBySide">
									<img src="images/andie/CustomerLifecycle.png" style="width: 60%; flex : 1" />
									<p><b>As-is customer lifecycle</b> - highlighted key moments and headline discoveries from discovery research for how the service was performing.</p>
								</div>

								<h3><br /><br />Persona creation</h3>
								<p>From engaging with parts of the business it was evident that there was little understanding of who the customers are beyond key KPI’s. Many had not spoken directly to customers or engaged in customer research. Therefore the customer’s voice is not widely represented and customer needs are not consistently fed into initiatives.</p>
								<p>To improve this situation we created a set of customer personas. Working with the Product Lead to identify initial assumptions about customer types and further research goals. Then conducting sessions with service advisors to refine assumptions. Emerging themes were then validated with the data insights team to align with statistical representations.</p>

								</div>
								
								<div class="sideBySide">
									<img src="images/andie/Personas.png" style="width : 60%"/>
									<p><b>Customer personas</b> -  initial sessions with service agents gave a further understanding of the types of customers they deal with and the techniques used to identify them and adapt their service approach.<br /><br />This initial understanding was validated and further evolved with the data team before finalising a preliminary set of profiles.</p>
								</div>

								<h3><br/><br/>Outcome</h3>
								<p class="noPadding">Moved customer perspective beyond just key data points, such as no claims discount, to include:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Driver life-stage</li>
									<li>Needs relating to knowledge and experience in car insurance</li>
									<li>Attitudes towards contract responsibilities</li>
									<li>Ability to interact with a company such as a service centre team</li>
								</ul>

								<h2><br />JOURNEY STAGE: ACQUISITION</h2>
								<h3>Discovery research</h3>
								<p class="noPadding">Usability testing, customer surveys & path analysis identified:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Brand and telematics proposition is poorly communicated</li>
									<li>Broad variations in policyholders insurance knowledge, typically related to years of driving or situations encountered as a driver</li>
									<li>Parents are heavily involved with new drivers when making key decisions and ongoing management of the policy</li>
									<li>Prospects via pricing aggregator encountered most challenges in the onward journey to purchase</li>
								</ul>

								<H3>Journey optimisation</H3>
								<p>Redesign and optimisation plan identified must-have hygiene features for an acquisition journey. And a series of experiment opportunities to further improve the 
								acquisition. <br/>Worked alongside Content Specialist and Visual Designer to overhaul the product landing page and enhancements to key moments of policy quote and buy steps.</p>

								</div>

								<H3><br />Outcome</H3>
								<P>This created an <b>uplift in policy conversions of 56%</b> through online for its first 3 months of being live.</P>
								
								<br />
								<h2>JOURNEY STAGE: POLICY USE</h2>
								<h3>Discovery findings</h3>
								<p class="noPadding">Identified key journey moments to focus on a new experience vision, main issues included:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Disjointed experience with partners esp. box installation and finance provider creating a bad impression in the first days of the policy</li>
									<li>Customer data integrity issues that fundamentally affect communications and ongoing engagement with policyholders</li>
									<li>Low customer portal engagement and limited self-serve capabilities</li>
									<li>Misunderstanding of hidden fees causes customer stress and annoyance</li>
									<li>The claims process is difficult for a new driver to be effective</li>
								</ul>

								<h3>Problem framing and concept design</h3>
								<p>Each journey key moment was framed for ideation by identifying a goal, discoveries and context from initial research and opportunities to improve the current as-is experience.</p>
								<div class="sideBySide">
									<img src="images/andie/DesignFraming.png" style="width: 60%;" />
									<p><b>Design framing for accident claim key moment</b> - align overarching goal with relevant context discoveries (business, customer, technology) to be interpreted into a series of opportunities as How Might We Q’s.</p>
								</div>
								<br />
								<div class="sideBySide">
									<img src="images/andie/ScenarioStoryboard.png" style="width: 60%;" />
									<p><b>Scenario storyboard for accident claim key moment</b> - selected ideas were formed into a scenario to communicate a vision for how the experience would occur.</p>
								</div>
								<h3><br />Outcome</h3>
								<p>Scenarios formed key parts of the service vision for a customer portal and policyholder engagement. This also informed a further phase of customer research to gather perspectives on assumed attitudes and needs.</p>
